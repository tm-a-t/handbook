# Quick Start

## Install Folds

```python
pip install folds
```

## Start a bot

1. **Obtain Telegram API keys if you don't have them.**
   Go to https://my.telegram.org and register an app.
   You may fill in any data, it doesn't really matter.
   I believe you can register an app only once and always reuse it afterwards.

2. **Register a bot.**
   Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and follow the instructions.
   You will get the token to control the bot.

3. **Type the code:**

   ```python
   (example)
   ```

4. **Run the app.**
