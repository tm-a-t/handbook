# Papercraft Book

Welcome to Papercraft Book! 
This is your guide to developing user-friendly, featureful, and stable bots for Telegram messenger.

Here is a couple of things that you can expect:

- **The book is independent of programming language and libraries.** 
It is designed to be used together with library docs and Telegram API reference.

- **The book covers all major features of Telegram bot platform,** starting from as common as `/commands` and ending with the most specific ones:
like managing join requests and subtopics in groups.

- **The book focuses on bots' UX.** We will discuss ways of user-bot interaction and best practices.

In other words, on these pages I tried to collect everything that you will want to know but probably won't find in your library docs.


## How to use the book

**Before development:** I recommend you skim over the "Development" section before starting a bot. It covers working with API,
choosing libraries, and other technical details. You may want to skim the following sections as well to have
a better understanding of the Telegram features.

If you plan to develop a bot with rather uncommon features or capacity, the corresponding pages will be helpful.

**During development:** You can consult the book to dive into the details of a topic.
