# Telegram Bots: The Very Basics

As you know, "Telegram bot" means a Telegram user account controlled by a server program.

Bots can have dialogs with users, send messages, reply to commands
from users, send pictures, be members of groups and channels, and so on.

However, bots have some limitations compared to real users, mainly in order to keep users' privacy. For example, bots
can't join groups and have to be added by users.

::: info
Although technically bots are a kind of user accounts, in this book I use the term "users" to refer to people's accounts.

## How to program a bot

Here is a short answer:

1. Register a bot.
2. Choose a library for your favorite programming language.
3. Write code with the help of the library docs and this book.

Note that although you can run the bot program on your computer, you will want to use hosting when the code is ready.

All these steps are covered in detail in the "Development" chapter.
