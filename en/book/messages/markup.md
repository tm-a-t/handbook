# Extensive Text Formatting in Telegram Messages

Sometimes you want to decorate text in your messages to highlight important things or refer to URLs and users.
There is a lot of formatting options in Telegram, so please don't get carried away :) The simpler, the better.

Markup elements in Telegram messages include:

- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- <u>Underlined text</u>
- <del>Strikethrough text</del>
- `Monospaced text`
- [Links](#)
- Spoilers, which mean hidden text (see below)
- User mentions through their ID (see below)
- Block quotation (which can be expandable)
- Custom emoji (which are available only for bots with [paid usernames](../dev/usernames))

A message may contain no more than 100 such markup elements. If you try to send a message with more,
the rest will be ignored.
In addition to them, a message may contain any number of username mentions. 
(Only five mentions will work as a user notification though; see below.)

Bot API allows specifying message markup in HTML or Markdown. Telegram API does not have this functionality built-in,
but Telegram API libraries like Telethon and Pyrogram support similar syntax.

## Monospaced text

Monospaced can be a piece of text (similar to `<code>` in HTML) or a block (similar to `<pre>`).

When sending a monospaced text block, you can specify code language so that Telegram apps will apply syntax highlighting.

## Spoiler

A spoiler is some text hidden behind an animated cover.

Pictures can be hidden with a spoiler as well, though this is not related to message markup.

## User mentions { #mention }

A mention is clickable text which leads to a user profile. To insert a mention using Bot API, you can embed a link 
of form `tg://user?ID=123456789`. A username of a user turns into a mention automatically.

When a group member gets mentioned, they get a notification. However, if a message contains more than five mentions,
only five users will get such notifications.

Bot may mention a user through ID only if they participate in the current chat or have turned on linking them 
while forwarding their messages. In addition, a bot must [have seen](../chats/pm#seen-users) the user.

Username mentions are technically regular text. When a user clicks on 
a username mention, Telegram app fetches info about the username owner.
On contrary, when sending ID mentions, the sender specifies the mentioned user ID which becomes a part of the message.
Recipients get the user profile together with the message, so the mention will be clickable even if the user changes 
their username.
